## PCB files

### Where to order
You can order the custom PCB's at JLCPCB: [https://jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).  
Upload both files to see the price.

### Edit the files
I have used EasyEDA to create the PCB files.  
You can download EasyEDA [here](https://easyeda.com/en).  
If you are not familiar with EasyEDA, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e4lOJeqAc8) is a quick tutorial.  
You can import the JSON files in order to edit them.
